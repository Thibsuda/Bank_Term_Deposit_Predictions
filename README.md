## 1. Problem Definition

### Predictive Modeling :
 I'm diving into a thrilling project focused on predicting customer subscriptions to term deposits. Picture this: I'll be analyzing customer data like age, occupation, and marital status to uncover insights that could revolutionize our marketing strategies.



### Customer Segmentation:
I'm using different machine learning models to predict term deposit subscriptions from imbalanced data. Models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and LinearSVC are evaluated using AUC-PRC scores on validation and test sets. The dataset also allows for customer segmentation analysis, helping banks tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer segments with varying subscription propensities.

### Campaign Optimizationüìå
The dataset can also be used for optimizing marketing campaigns. By analyzing the effectiveness of different communication types (contact), number of contacts performed (campaign), duration of contact, and outcome of previous campaigns (poutcome), banks can gain insights into which strategies are most successful in driving subscriptions. This information can help in optimizing future campaign efforts for better results

## 2. Dataüìù


This dataset, titled Direct Marketing Campaigns for Bank Term Deposits, is a collection of data related to the direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. These campaigns primarily involved phone calls with customers, and the objective was to determine whether or not a customer would subscribe to a term deposit offered by the bank.
